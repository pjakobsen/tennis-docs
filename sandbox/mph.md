#### Basic Throwing Skills

##### 4 Power Producing Concepts
Models of leverage that can be incorporated into the serve

Grab racket with tennis balls
It all stars with a good initial pull of the racquet to get the energy started

The upward pitch
Up the mountain.   Don't direct power forward, throw up, not into the side of the mountain but up the side of the mountain.  !! Try doing my forward slap, but slap up instead of into the fence.

Don't start to float down during the swing, so the power goes into the side of the mountain.  The energy should be projected up and over the top, creating a nice arch over the net.  Look at the hips to see if they are angled up at contact

### The Upward Pitching Motion

Pronation: Pull towards contact, but roll away the elbow. 

"Pronation is a process that will occur naturally. You don't have to mechanically force it to happen by trying to force your arm through. If you pull in the direction up the mountain to contact, have the ball in the right place, and have the pro grip, the racquet head speed takes itself over the top, and this is key because this is the only movement that takes the ball down into the court.  Everything you are doing is heading up the mountain. We're not trying to drive the ball into the court, we are trying to drive our racquet up to contact.
