Letting Go and Speeding Up
--------------------------

You have to let go and stop thinking but need to develop skills first before getting to the point where we can let go, piano, tennis, anything.
But first we must let go of preconceived misconceptions that hold us back from  letting go and playing with fluidity.
The way we learn the game unfortunately reinforces the fears, habits and biases that we are actually trying to overcome eg.  Prepare early, come through contact from back to front in  a very static motion; there is no timing, there is no focus, and no speed in this process.  It's pushing.

1st. Drill

We're going to "flip the ball" by the action of pushing and torquing .  
Push into the ball and turn it.  
It's like learning to throw a ball.
Progression is simply then work with he body to add a little more power. 
Focus is on torquing action at impact.  the focus is in the flipping action and the turn of the ball
Come at the ball from the side and turn it

To get this feel of turning and pushing, choke up on racquet, push ball into the net tape, then roll the ball over the net tape.
Feel the handle pushing forward while the tip is held back, then roll.  What will happen is the handle will 
actually come back tip shoots forward.  A quick reversal of positions.  The shoulder and elbow turn up during this move. 

Video at 6 minutes

Now step back and try it from further back.  feel the power that comes from the cocking of the wrist and the correct release of the turn.
Keep the hand very light and get very close to the ball.   You should feel a little bit of backwards action out of the elbow

"Speed in tennis is based on a light rhythmic action, like throwing, fly-fishing, or cracking a whip"

It's a tiny subtle quick little whip like quality that is at the heart of the power game.

**

Conventional and instinctual method of attaining speed is to swing hard towards the target.  It may produce speed, but it also produces a crashing effect, or chaos. The correct amount of speed is created by turned lightly folds away backwards away from the target, which is the whip effect. 
Unconventional way to get speed is via the whip effect: We fold the racquet back and become dealigned to the target. Demonstrated a little less than half way through

After the whip effect, we just turn the shoulder forward and around to finish

* Control*   Our intent, lining up the ball.   Instintual is get the racquet to follow this line.   But the body does not like to go in straight lines, everything is made to rotate in cicular actions.  Next, make a push that makes it feel like you are turning the ball or torquing

Next topic: Timing - Conventional view is that "we don't have anought time" and so we rush to prepare early. 

Gravity is available, but only for a split second. *Work on timing and rhythm  of fall of raquet into the slot, using gravity momentum to create whip-effect.*  Understanding how to be patient. Turns away and under the ball, and turn up and away on the side (more on this later)

.. class: handout
**The "swing through the ball" to target model makes it very difficult to keep the head down.**
**Good playes are oriented to the side and are executing whip-like stroking model** (

Have to look at things in a more  counter-intuitive way if you ever hope to become a more skilled player. 

How to hold the racquet, perhaps the most important thing:

**Conventionally, we hold the racquet in a way that helps us line the racquet up to target so we can "swing" the racquet.**  
**Better players hold racquet to "not swing", so racqut can fold backwards and create whip stroking action**

More imporant content from end of this video, but would prefer to have times

	Drop hit excercise

Dynamic Contact Awareness
-------------------------

How do fingers work to manipulate a large ball going up and down, and helps to regulate and control that energe. Controlled dynamic interaction with the ball. 
Don't crash agains the ball
Suppleness of manipulating the ball is in the fingers because they can give and push back.  Flowing exchange with the ball. 

**We should 'stroke' balls, not 'hit' them** in all sports.  This is touch.  Feel the large ball with racque
**Dribble ball with racquet, feeling rise and fall of ball** Fingers working with it in a controlled way.  Ball going in and out of racquet, this is touch.
Now introduce tennis ball. Certain softness and suppleness coming out of contact.
**Practice crossover dribble of tennis ball, feeling surface of ball**  drill
**Turn and catch ball to develop catch-throw feel (like dribble)** drill, rotating around surface of ball while moving it as little as possible during the turn (dribble is catching and throwing 
Turn and drive ball forward drill, push to the side and rotate
**Feel push to side and drive with shoulder in this little sling of ball with racquet** drill  Really important drill!
