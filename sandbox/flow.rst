The Sword in the Stone
======================

Conventional and instinctual method of attaining speed is to swing hard towards the target.  It may produce speed, but it also produces a crashing effect, or chaos. The correct amount of speed is created by turned lightly folds away backwards away from the target, which is the whip effect. 
Unconventional way to get speed is via the whip effect: We fold the racquet back and become dealigned to the target. Demonstrated a little less than half way through

After the whip effect, we just turn the shoulder forward and around to finish

* Control*   Our intent, lining up the ball.   Instintual is get the racquet to follow this line.   But the body does not like to go in straight lines, everything is made to rotate in cicular actions.  Next, make a push that makes it feel like you are turning the ball or torquing

Next topic: Timing - Conventional view is that "we don't have anought time" and so we rush to prepare early. 

Gravity is available, but only for a split second. *Work on timing and rhythm  of fall of raquet into the slot, using gravity momentum to create whip-effect.*  Understanding how to be patient. Turns away and under the ball, and turn up and away on the side (more on this later)

*The "swing through the ball" to target model makes it very difficult to keep the head down.*
*Good playes are oriented to the side and are executing whip-like stroking model*
*Better players hold the racquet to "not swing" so can 

How to hold the racquet, perhaps the most important thing:

*Conventionally, we hold the racquet in a way that helps us line the racquet up to target so we can "swing" the racquet.*
*Better players hold racquet to "not swing", so racqut can fold backwards and create whip stroking action*
