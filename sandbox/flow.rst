Letting Go and Speeding Up
--------------------------

You have to let go and stop thinking but need to develop skills first before getting to the point where we can let go, piano, tennis, anything.
But first we must let go of preconceived misconceptions that hold us back from  letting go and playing with fluidity.
The way we learn the game unfortunately reinforces the fears, habits and biases that we are actually trying to overcome eg.  Prepare early, come through contact from back to front in  a very static motion; there is no timing, there is no focus, and no speed in this process.  It's pushing.

1st. Drill

We're going to "flip the ball" by the action of pushing and torquing .  
Push into the ball and turn it.  
It's like learning to throw a ball.
Progression is simply then work with he body to add a little more power. 
Focus is on torquing action at impact.  the focus is in the flipping action and the turn of the ball
Come at the ball from the side and turn it

To get this feel of turning and pushing, choke up on racquet, push ball into the net tape, then roll the ball over the net tape.
Feel the handle pushing forward while the tip is held back, then roll.  What will happen is the handle will 
actually come back tip shoots forward.  A quick reversal of positions.  The shoulder and elbow turn up during this move. 

Video at 6 minutes

Now step back and try it from further back.  feel the power that comes from the cocking of the wrist and the correct release of the turn.
Keep the hand very light and get very close to the ball.   You should feel a little bit of backwards action out of the elbow

"Speed in tennis is based on a light rhythmic action, like throwing, fly-fishing, or cracking a whip"

It's a tiny subtle quick little whip like quality that is at the heart of the power game.

Elements of Flow
================

Dynamic Ready Position
----------------------

Core Energy
-----------

Lock and Key
------------

Length:  18:34

* 5:45 - The "key" in our stroke is NOT the racquet, but a feel coming out of the hand. 
* 6:25 - We feel "key insertion" and push and turn coming out of our base index knuckle.
* 10:00 - Come into lower inside of the ball with index knuckle as you turn and push on ball. 

Drive is coming from turning. 
13:10 I can feel my left hip pull

12:49 - Our speed element, our whip element is coming from that change in direction.
16:50 Stepping stone release on serve.

* 18:30 Proper "lock and key" dynamic unlocks the blend of speed and drive we're looking for in whip drive. 
The Sword in the Stone
----------------------

**

Conventional and instinctual method of attaining speed is to swing hard towards the target.  It may produce speed, but it also produces a crashing effect, or chaos. The correct amount of speed is created by turned lightly folds away backwards away from the target, which is the whip effect. 
Unconventional way to get speed is via the whip effect: We fold the racquet back and become dealigned to the target. Demonstrated a little less than half way through

After the whip effect, we just turn the shoulder forward and around to finish

* Control*   Our intent, lining up the ball.   Instintual is get the racquet to follow this line.   But the body does not like to go in straight lines, everything is made to rotate in cicular actions.  Next, make a push that makes it feel like you are turning the ball or torquing

Next topic: Timing - Conventional view is that "we don't have anought time" and so we rush to prepare early. 

Gravity is available, but only for a split second. *Work on timing and rhythm  of fall of raquet into the slot, using gravity momentum to create whip-effect.*  Understanding how to be patient. Turns away and under the ball, and turn up and away on the side (more on this later)

.. class: handout
**The "swing through the ball" to target model makes it very difficult to keep the head down.**
**Good playes are oriented to the side and are executing whip-like stroking model** (

Have to look at things in a more  counter-intuitive way if you ever hope to become a more skilled player. 

How to hold the racquet, perhaps the most important thing:

**Conventionally, we hold the racquet in a way that helps us line the racquet up to target so we can "swing" the racquet.**  
**Better players hold racquet to "not swing", so racqut can fold backwards and create whip stroking action**

More imporant content from end of this video, but would prefer to have times

	Drop hit excercise

Dynamic Contact Awareness
-------------------------

How do fingers work to manipulate a large ball going up and down, and helps to regulate and control that energe. Controlled dynamic interaction with the ball. 
Don't crash agains the ball
Suppleness of manipulating the ball is in the fingers because they can give and push back.  Flowing exchange with the ball. 

**We should 'stroke' balls, not 'hit' them** in all sports.  This is touch.  Feel the large ball with racque
**Dribble ball with racquet, feeling rise and fall of ball** Fingers working with it in a controlled way.  Ball going in and out of racquet, this is touch.
Now introduce tennis ball. Certain softness and suppleness coming out of contact.
**Practice crossover dribble of tennis ball, feeling surface of ball**  drill
**Turn and catch ball to develop catch-throw feel (like dribble)** drill, rotating around surface of ball while moving it as little as possible during the turn (dribble is catching and throwing 

Turn and drive ball forward drill, push to the side and rotate

* **Feel push to side and drive with shoulder in this little sling of ball with racquet** drill  Really important drill!
* **Push out to side and flip the ball--feel ball travel from tip to throat of racquet**
* **On topspin shot, we start from inside of ball and push to the outside-drive occurs on outside of ball**
* **Great players are "throwing" the ball out of the racquet in a short power burts on ball--not swinging through the ball**
* **We coil so we can uncoil and put more energy into "catch-and-release" of ball.**
* **Feel like you are throwing from mid-section of body**
* **We coil to prepare for throwing action**
Feeling the ball beside you...
* **Great players feel the ball as they move with the ball**
Fed drills with pitched balls
* **Feel inside edge of ball**
* **Good players turn back with the ball, saving the hit**
* **Feel rotation and drive of shoulder, ending with shoulder near side of face.**
* **Feel different sides of ball, from top, to inside edge, then a push out and rotation from shoulder and body--modern forehand!**
* **Rowers wait until oar reaches its maximum resistance point in the water, the water feels like concrete, and then they excert force**
* Rowers are saving their stroke for a moment of maximum resistance
* Great playes find that moment of maximum resistance, and "locking on ball" and pushing and "turning on it" with shoulder and body.



Wrap-up. The timing of dynamic contact awareness

Winding up around sphere around body 

* **We save the "hit" for the moment of maximum resistance--the moment we "turn on the ball".**
 We are pushing into contact points, excert energy into them .  Getting into  a chair. 

 * **Skier plants pole - becomes a contact point the skier can rotate body on**




Whip-Drive, A Deeper Look
-------------------------
Video Length: 28.54

* Drive is steering stroke element that comes from large muscle group, particularly the shoulder. 
* 

A fully developed stroke has speed, spin, touch, and drive
Be able to 	move the racquet into the ball in a way that unlocks the shoulder drive on the ball
* 1:46 We want speed going in and drive on the ball
* 

Speed is very light coming out of the hands, we're going to look at how to insert that speed a certain way so that it unlocks the drive on the ball

* 3:34 Common mistake is to put whip into ball too directly
* 7:08 We release the whip action out to the side
* 9:42 Drive is the feel of racquet settling into correctly, and then accelerate the shoulder correctly.
* 10:25 Internal Shoulder Rotation that produces fast throwing action is fastest part of the human body.
* 11:48 We should feel a "letting go" of racquet going into ball and a disappearing racquet feel. 
* 20:18 We need a roadmap to go where we want to go

25:30 Excellent serve explanation, combining whip and drive

* 26:26 Use light whip action to open up shoulder drive

All these parts have to work together for any of these parts to work well. 

* 28:32 We need to maximize and integrate all parts of the stroke 


Fire in Napa, Part 1

17:05

0:38 Tennis Fire: Exlplosive Fire of movement and contact, and Fire in the belly to compete and excel	

Fire in Napa, Part 2
--------------------

Length 37:40

Summary:  Footwork 

* 6:24 - At contact, we co-ordinate our maximum effort at a point of maximum resistance with maximum leverage. 
* 10:42 - Jump, land, push, and drive

Key Positions & Advanced Flow Training
======================================

3.1 Training & Kata Introduction
--------------------------------

3.11 Kata Introduction
----------------------

Length: 2:40

* 00:50 - Katas are specific movements within an action (serve) that we can practice and perfect

3.12 Nature of Fluidity
-----------------------

* 0:58 - We need to integrate many different movements and feels into a single action -- this gives us fluidity.
* 2:18 - Segmentation allows us to study how each part of the body functions and feels. 

3.2 Serve Training
------------------

3.2.11  Kata Training :)
-----------------------

Length: 47.42 

Each part of the body has a different function; we need to study each one of them seperately in order to put them together perfectly, because if one pieze of the puzzle works better, the next piece of the puzzle is going to work better too.  This is what true efficiency is aka getting into the flow.

Example, Laura Robson & Venus Williams, too much looseness at the beginning of the swing means that the lower body doesn't get wound up properly because they are feeling too loose.  The looseness is very important AT at particular stage,  is needed only at certain points, but lower body must get wound up to produce drive in the right place.

12:40 Kata 1 Explanation:  Wind the bottom parts but stop at certain parts, which will create more speed in the unwinding of the upper parts.   A feeling of
being tighter and more forceful down below to gradually more flexible and loose and lighter as we go higher above.

14;00 1.  Feet	Winding bottom parts should be restricted solid tighter coils / movements.   Feel a turn and a stop, then another turn and stop rather than large sweeping actions.
Left foot 45*, right foot too line up with intersection with front toe to the target, shoulder width apart.  Coil and drive into the ground

15:30 Breath: Should feel it below, if it's too high in chest, it's tightness. Breath is activity / energy center.  Feel activity in the gut with the breath. 
Let the shoulders relax, fully committed mind set, not jumpy mind 

17:25  First move; good arm positioning, create a form with hands above waist.  

18:20 Start with a turn and a slight dip.  feel that you are going into the balls of the feet.  Feel a flex and a push, like sitting down into a chair

18:45  Start to feel the chin coming up a little bit ,start to lift just slightly.  This will start the feel of bringing the shoulders back. Don't drop the hands to imitiate the toss, because the focus here is to work the legs.
Trying to make the toss to straight is the cause of a lot of problems on the serve.Let is stay in flow and form not rigid, or it will lead to broken movements.  HOLD FORM.  Elbows out a little bit.

21:00 1.  Grind down, elbows open slightly by using shoulders,  the head will start to come back a little bit, heels slightly off the ground, feel arms as critical to balancing you into the ground. Get good a coiling well, as you start to look up.

KATA 2:  take back position to trophy position

23:20

23:38 Start to key in on upward target. 
24:35 It's like your wrist is in cast on the way up, keep it quiet, not wristy, but steady.  This steadyness will focus the energy into the places that you do want to move and coil, and that's number 1 the big parts.

Trophy position, arm up and elbow cocked back like bow and arrow.  how do we get there?

25:30 We continue coiling the shoulders after the hips are already done coiling.  The shoulders are looser than the hips, they are going to go back more.
Feel a tension in the hips.  
26:10 As I continue to coil, I continue to tilt back face looking straight up, and feel more flexing down in the knees as part of the balancing. 
Getting more sky oriented is driving me deeper down into the ground in order to balance.  
26:42 Final and fullest rotation back with the shoulders. THe left arm is naturally going to want to balance you, like you are holding on to something to keep yourself steady.

27:45 When the head goes back, feel like you are squeezing a  ball on the back of your neck.

28:10 Feel the shoulders turn and rotate a little bit, Roddick style, so  you can look at knuckles, it's natural federer does it.  The racquet hand should naturally turn as well.
29:00 Feel your elbows go out a little bit at the end.

29:45 What does the right arm do?  Pull shoulder back like pulling bow and arrow.  Draw elbow and shoulder back, and let the hand come inward.
30:05 Don't try to feel swinging in the racquet in order to feel power. Swing stuff around causes stiffness in the midsection, taking coil energy away.

30:30 Imagine coiling and uncoiling inside a cone.  
31:03 * Practice the "large gears""

31:40 Bring the hands in , not let them go out to destabilize.  Takes confidence and patience to get beyond wanting to feel power and speed in the forceful feelin in racquet. 

KATA 3:  33:10  Back of the ladder

Starting to access the upper coils.  Tap into gravity somehow.
34:45 Get everything back behind me falling using gravity on the back side.
35:30 Kind of throw the head back which lets everything fall behind you.  Now with the sternum up to the sky, I'm going to push the sternum up and start to come around in a kind of a summersault action.
36:05 Lift the elbow and feel the hand come in like a karate chop up towards the sky.

KATA 4: 37:10 Trigger to Contact
dip of the shoulder starts cartwheeling action, but don't pull too hard.  IT's the hop that initiates the cartwheel
37:30 Imagine bringing your karate chop hand on to the outside of the ball.  This is where your hand would be if you were just throwing a ball into the sky.  
38:18 Grab the ball and feel as if you are going to throw it to the sky.  Grab, twist and release up into the sky.  Now the hand is loose, the hand is towards the ground.
39:10 There is a little coiling action in the wrist. Waving your hair around. Karate chop with fingers back as much as you can and thumb down, then grab and throw.  
39:55 The drive, feel the push from the shoulder rotating up into the ear, and push the head forward with the shoulder.  
40:25 Left shoulder driving your through the cartwheeling action.  Open the right arm pit up into the sky.  
40:36 To get the cartwheeling action, the hips will push back a little bit, and the left arm will get jammed back into the gut side.
51:50 Everything should feel engaged in the right moment of the release.  Left leg kicks back as part of the drive to contact

FINAL KATA: Trigger to contact to recovery. Continuation of Uncoiling 
45:17 Focus on the snap and how to finish to promote that snap.  Free up the shoulder, and concentrate on how to get real speed in the shoulder but very fluid
45:40 There is a dip to the side with the left shoulder, but don't pull across.
46:40  Don't square up or straighten the back. you can get more power by straigtening the back, but that's only if you are going to hit down into the court.
47:10  Don't level yourself out.  When you finish, the right shoulder is still up, scarecrow position
47:21 Scarecrow finish
