## Tennisspped Hall-of-Fame Forehand

My Question:  is all this simply keeping wrist neutral on takeback?

### Part 1: What is the Racket Really Doing in the Impact Zone?

Shut the racket face down throughout the entire stroke and shallow out your overall racket path, especially in the impact zone.

Further details of how to achieve this type of racket motion at the racket speeds needed to produce the identical results as players like Federer and Nadal are going to fill a lot of future blog posts

The highest topspin rates (nearly 40% higher compared to “center contact”) are produced when impact occurs near the bottom edge of the racket;

AND

The lowest topspin rates are produced when impact occurs near the top edge of the racket.

Especially for those seeking high-performance or “ultimate” performance, subtracting movements most often leads to reducing, not increasing performance.For the players we work with, it’s primarily correction by addition of movements.

And if you know which movements to add, the flawed ones seem to subtract themselves anyway. 

#### Comparing Federer and Hewitt

Take back: Racket faces side fence, not back. 

What happens during Transition directly influences spin production at impact. As generating sufficiently large quantities of topspin is absolutely required to counteract the added distance that high-speed shots travel compared to lower-speed ones so they stay in play. 

In other words, what happens during Transition is the basis of a (top) player’s ability to CONTROL THEIR SHOTS. 

Therefore, our conclusion at this point is that Transition may be the most important phase of the entire stroke.

Within Transition, perhaps the single most critical stage of Transition and perhaps the most critical stage of the entire stroke is shown on the image (on the video – what you see here is a still image of that first detectible motion) that shows the precise moments when there is the first clear evidence of the forward swing – the First Forward Move or FFM (Image 6).

Finally, it should also be mentioned here that, for all but the most gifted athletes, the FFM is also the “point of no return” in terms of forehand performance. 

Hewitts hand is supinated but Feds is pronated.

Really need to look at and read all the sequences on this page.  But the basic point is this:  The differences in strokes between pro players are huge.  The simplicity we see with our naked eye belies that complexity that rules the body mechanisms that produce them.

1) confirming those concepts that are authentically true and useful in delivering authentic player improvement; 2) debunking flawed and incorrect concepts; or, 3) modifying, refining and correcting a concept that is partially flawed or incorrect.

At the heart of all this, what we are doing at this stage is making a lot of close and careful observations, asking questions about what we see, and then trying to come up with testable ways of determining their validity and therefore, their instructional value to you.

Another thing that shapes our analyses is this: we believe that only the highest, best performers are really worth the time to analyze. We want focus our time and energy to understand the highest-performing, “ultimate” strokes from the sport’s top performers.

Strokes that don’t demonstrate “ultimate performance” are, by definition, somehow flawed.

### Part 5: Transition - The Second-Most Important Phase of the Forehand Stroke

http://blog.tennisspeed.com/2012/02/roadmap-to-hall-of-fame-forehand-part-5.html

In recent posts, we have alluded to the importance of a particular phase of the tennis forehand stroke that strongly influences the 
power and control of the resulting shot. 

This critical phase of the forehand occurs at the point where the backswing ends and the forward swing to impact begins. 

From this point on, let’s refer to this “switch-over” from backswing to forward swing as TRANSITION, or “FHT”, for short.

One of the two Transition types appears to be strongly correlated with higher topspin production, higher ball speeds, greater trajectory control and maybe what’s as important to pro players, lower incidence of chronic injuries to the racquet arm and shoulder.
So, not only does one FHT type appear to deliver higher performance, but also delivers higher performance with greater safety to long-term player health.

After looking at such a large number and wide range of forehands and the FHT used by their owners, we've come to rezlize that the movements that players use during FHT have a profound and fundamental influence on how you control your racquet in the Impact Zone.

What happens in the Impact Zone, most would agree, is the most important phase of the forehand as this is where the ball, strings, body and racquet interact directly. It is in the Impact Zone that the proverbial "rubber meets the road". Now that we realize that how the racquet arrives in the Impact Zone is so strongly influenced by what happens during FHT, around here, we have come to consider FHT as being the second-most important phase of the forehand.

### Part 6: Could Hall-of-Fame Performance be Determined by a Single Movement?

http://blog.tennisspeed.com/2012/05/roadmap-to-hall-of-fame-forehand-part-6.html

FHT = Forehand Transition

"What exactly is the difference between FHT-1 and FHT-2?"

So far, we’ve identified at least 30 distinct micromoves used by the outliers that are largely “missing” from the topspin forehand mechanics of the "non-outliers".  we noticed that there appears to be a single, specific micromove that the fastest and heaviest forehands in the sport consistently demonstrate during the critical phase of FHT. What’s even more interesting is we began to realize that this particular micromove is missing—rather, is not used—by those players whose forehands desert them and break down under the pressure of competing for the sport’s biggest titles.

This specific micromove is ELBOW PRONATION of the racquet arm at the very end of FHT during the fleeting moments when players initiate the forward swing to impact— aka the FFM, or “First Forward Move”. 

**Elbow PRONATION at FFM = FHT-2

Elbow SUPINATION at FFM = FHT-1 **

The “natural motion” of the racquet arm in a tennis forehand naturally causes the racquet hand to supinate – meaning the palm of the hand will open toward the sky as you swing forward to impact. Therefore, if you don’t compensate for the hand supination by intentionally pronating the hand – pointing your palm downward toward the ground – your hand will deliver the racquet face in an open position at impact. 

In other words, when players pronate their racquet hand just before they start their forward swing, their pronated racquet hand position enables them to control the natural supination of the racquet hand (and arm) during the forward swing and control the angle of the racquet face as it approaches impact.
And, it appears that that achieving this pronated position before FFM greatly reduces the amount of conscious effort on the player’s part to create – “on the fly” – the closed racquet position at impact that’s associated with maximal topspin production.
o, what is the relationship between racquet hand pronation at FFM and maximal force production by the rotator cuff muscles – specifically the contraction of the subscapularis muscle used to create the internal rotation of the shoulder that propels your (racquet) arm forwards to impact?
The relationship between these two movements and how it influences force production goes like this:
By pronating the racquet hand at this stage, this position prevents "premature" external rotation of the shoulder – because external rotation (“ER”) of the shoulder prior to the internal rotation (“IR”) of the shoulder enables you to tap into the force-multiplying effects of what’s called the Stretch-Shortening Cycle, or “SSC”.

Applied to the topspin forehand, there is a 50 millisecond “window” of opportunity to produce maximal force after ER creates that pre-stretch of the IR muscles.

The “optimization” the SSC of the rotator cuff is but one of several key SSCs that operate in a top-level topspin forehand.

The vast majority of tennis players hit their heaviest topspin forehands by attempting a wide variety of body movements to create the stroke geometry associated with high-speed, high-spin forehands. The commonality of the topspin-amplifying technique/movements used by the vast majority of players is that these involve consciously manipulating the racquet hand and arm during the 100 or so milliseconds before impact.
 
These contrived movements commonly include such movements known as: “windshield-wipering”, ” wrist action”, “wrist rolling” or “wrist flipping”, “brushing up at impact”, “reverse finishing", etc. , etc., etc..  All of these movements involve highly conscious, and often last-second, timing-intensive racquet manipulation where required stroke consistency can only be achieved with an inordinate amount of practice time that’s only really available to serious competitive players.

You see, if you understand the “natural motion” of the racquet arm in the forward swing to impact of a tennis forehand, and combine this with a firm understanding of the “impact geometry” that’s needed to create large amounts of topspin, we can drastically reduce the number of variables to adjust (as well as the amount of practice time) if you’re seeking more topspin (and speed) on your forehand to these three essential concepts:
1)      You need to pronate the elbow of your hitting arm before starting the forward swing – to the same extent as the players pictured earlier—to compensate for the natural supination – or opening of the hand causing the palm to face skyward – of the racquet elbow /hand to ensure that you can deliver the racquet face in a closed position – i.e. racquet tilted forward—at impact.
2)      You can start to experiment with how steep or how shallow your upward swing path affects the resulting shot. The simplest way to do this is to start experimenting with how far below the impact point you start your forward swing. You might also experiment with the height at which your racquet hand finishes after impact. You may find that you produce more topspin when you shallow out your overall swing path and use a finish lower versus swinging more steeply upwards and finishing high – when the racquet hand finishes up at head-height or higher. And, you should note that this concept effectively runs counter to the “how topspin is produced” paradigm ingrained into the “stroke knowledge” of most tennis players and coaches possess.
3)      You need to learn when and how to pronate your hand – or “re-pronate” is the more appropriate description—as you accelerate your racquet through the impact zone. Elbow Pronation in the impact zone is how you can support, stabilize and maintain the forward tilt of the racquet face at impact, especially when impact is made off-center. Elbow Pronation of the racquet arm at FFM and just prior to impact creates maximum racquet speed and acceleration to maximize energy transfer to the ball. In other words, Elbow Pronation plays a crucial role in maximizing both spin production and ball speed.
