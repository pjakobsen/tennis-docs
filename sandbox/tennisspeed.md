## Tennisspped Hall-of-Fame Forehand

### Part 1: What is the Racket Really Doing in the Impact Zone?

Shut the racket face down throughout the entire stroke and shallow out your overall racket path, especially in the impact zone.

Further details of how to achieve this type of racket motion at the racket speeds needed to produce the identical results as players like Federer and Nadal are going to fill a lot of future blog posts

The highest topspin rates (nearly 40% higher compared to “center contact”) are produced when impact occurs near the bottom edge of the racket;

AND

The lowest topspin rates are produced when impact occurs near the top edge of the racket.

Especially for those seeking high-performance or “ultimate” performance, subtracting movements most often leads to reducing, not increasing performance.For the players we work with, it’s primarily correction by addition of movements.

And if you know which movements to add, the flawed ones seem to subtract themselves anyway. 

#### Comparing Federer and Hewitt

Take back: Racket faces side fence, not back. 

What happens during Transition directly influences spin production at impact. As generating sufficiently large quantities of topspin is absolutely required to counteract the added distance that high-speed shots travel compared to lower-speed ones so they stay in play. 

In other words, what happens during Transition is the basis of a (top) player’s ability to CONTROL THEIR SHOTS. 

Therefore, our conclusion at this point is that Transition may be the most important phase of the entire stroke.

Within Transition, perhaps the single most critical stage of Transition and perhaps the most critical stage of the entire stroke is shown on the image (on the video – what you see here is a still image of that first detectible motion) that shows the precise moments when there is the first clear evidence of the forward swing – the First Forward Move or FFM (Image 6).

Finally, it should also be mentioned here that, for all but the most gifted athletes, the FFM is also the “point of no return” in terms of forehand performance. 

Hewitts hand is supinated but Feds is pronated.

Really need to look at and read all the sequences on this page.  But the basic point is this:  The differences in strokes between pro players are huge.  The simplicity we see with our naked eye belies that complexity that rules the body mechanisms that produce them.

1) confirming those concepts that are authentically true and useful in delivering authentic player improvement; 2) debunking flawed and incorrect concepts; or, 3) modifying, refining and correcting a concept that is partially flawed or incorrect.

At the heart of all this, what we are doing at this stage is making a lot of close and careful observations, asking questions about what we see, and then trying to come up with testable ways of determining their validity and therefore, their instructional value to you.

Another thing that shapes our analyses is this: we believe that only the highest, best performers are really worth the time to analyze. We want focus our time and energy to understand the highest-performing, “ultimate” strokes from the sport’s top performers.

Strokes that don’t demonstrate “ultimate performance” are, by definition, somehow flawed.

#### Stages of stroke
1. The Ready Position
2. Breaking the Triangle
3. Completed Backswing
4. First Forward Move (FFM)
5. 20 frames (95.2 milliseconds) before Impact
6. 10 Frames (47.6 milliseconds) Before Impact

8. 5 Frames (23.8 milliseconds) after Impact
9. Follow-Through - Hands at Shoulder Height
10. End of Stroke

### Part 5: Transition - The Second-Most Important Phase of the Forehand Stroke

http://blog.tennisspeed.com/2012/02/roadmap-to-hall-of-fame-forehand-part-5.html

In recent posts, we have alluded to the importance of a particular phase of the tennis forehand stroke that strongly influences the 
power and control of the resulting shot. 

This critical phase of the forehand occurs at the point where the backswing ends and the forward swing to impact begins. 

From this point on, let’s refer to this “switch-over” from backswing to forward swing as TRANSITION, or “FHT”, for short.

One of the two Transition types appears to be strongly correlated with higher topspin production, higher ball speeds, greater trajectory control and maybe what’s as important to pro players, lower incidence of chronic injuries to the racquet arm and shoulder.
So, not only does one FHT type appear to deliver higher performance, but also delivers higher performance with greater safety to long-term player health.

After looking at such a large number and wide range of forehands and the FHT used by their owners, we've come to rezlize that the movements that players use during FHT have a profound and fundamental influence on how you control your racquet in the Impact Zone.

What happens in the Impact Zone, most would agree, is the most important phase of the forehand as this is where the ball, strings, body and racquet interact directly. It is in the Impact Zone that the proverbial "rubber meets the road". Now that we realize that how the racquet arrives in the Impact Zone is so strongly influenced by what happens during FHT, around here, we have come to consider FHT as being the second-most important phase of the forehand.
