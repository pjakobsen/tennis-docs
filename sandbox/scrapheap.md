There are two  special feelings on the forehand.   
1) Staying sideways and starting acceleration very early, like the day I pounded the ball at Mark Chew.  
2) VERY SPECIAL feeling up being wound up and ready and having plenty of time to unwind so that the hit gets perfectly timed way out front.  This caused a feeling of great control and easy power, but the timing must be excellent. 

Stay sideways on mini tennis forehand!  Wind early, but be wound tight at the right time so I can unwind at a moments notice at exactly as the ball is still quite far from the optimal strike point way out front, it should feel like there is plenty of time to uncork out to it. 

During mini tennis, I got awesome feeling of arming naturally straightening as I go out the 45, it wasn't done on purpose, it just happened as a result of better orientation. 

Neutral wrist did not work nor feel important, is the feeling of beach ball containment of the stroke. 

Clearly the neutral wrist is a good feeling, but the hand must really drop early and stay chest side for this to work. Don't let the arm get back. 


Tried the jump backhand, worked well. Stab slice was great today.   

Producing racquet head speed with very little effort.  It's possible to produce  racquet head speed using almost no effort;  using the sine curve feeling on the forehand produces a small swoosh with almost no effort and the wrist folds and unfolds into the leveraged position.  Try to get the same feeling on the serve, use film to compare wrist movement. 


Forehand crazy cut slice: Catch it way out in front    !!!!  Crazy side spin
