#### Summary

1. Torquing Action

#### 1. Letting Go and Speeding Up

You have to let go and stop thinking but need to develop skills first before getting to the point where we can let go, piano, tennis, anything.
But first we must let go of preconceived misconceptions that hold us back from  letting go and playing with fluidity.
The way we learn the game unfortunately reinforces the fears, habits and biases that we are actually trying to overcome eg.  Prepare early, come through contact from back to front in  a very static motion; there is no timing, there is no focus, and no speed in this process.  It's pushing.

##### 1st. Drill

We're going to "flip the ball" by the action of pushing and torquing .  
Push into the ball and turn it.  
It's like learning to throw a ball.
Progression is simply then work with he body to add a little more power. 
Focus is on torquing action at impact.  the focus is in the flipping action and the turn of the ball
Come at the ball from the side and turn it

To get this feel of turning and pushing, choke up on racquet, push ball into the net tape, then roll the ball over the net tape.
Feel the handle pushing forward while the tip is held back, then roll.  What will happen is the handle will 
actually come back tip shoots forward.  A quick reversal of positions.  The shoulder and elbow turn up during this move.

Now step back and try it from further back.  feel the power that comes from the cocking of the wrist and the correct release of the turn.
Keep the hand very light and get very close to the ball.   You should feel a little bit of backwards action out of the elbow

"Speed in tennis is based on a light rhythmic action, like throwing, fly-fishing, or cracking a whip"

It's a tiny subtle quick little whip like quality that is at the heart of the power game.
