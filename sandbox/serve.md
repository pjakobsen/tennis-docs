Serve
Setup, wrist breathe means big exhale,
Toss higher.jump way into the court.  Finish leaning over with counter balanced kick back.  Get the wrist into it properly.

It's possible to produce  racquet head speed using almost no effort;  using the s curve feeling on the forehand produces a small swoosh with almost no effort and the wrist folds and unfolds into the leveraged position.  
Try to get the same feeling on the serve, use film to compare wrist movement. 

Use chest finish on kick serve to keep body and thus racquet from turning during the swing, thereby spoiling the cutting swing path

Convex or bowed arm at beginning  of serve and forehand is HUGE, but it has to be subtle in it's inmplementation.  The proper reason for it must be defined.

Stay very chest side for more serve side scratch power. Involve fingers by snapping handle into heel of palm , more side speed

Is the possible to get same feeling on the serve as on the forehand, namely pulling the racquet across the chest Dougherty style?

Get the tip under the elbow shoulder on take back

Hack directly sideways without turning head to look forward during stroke

Bongo slap onto leveraged wrist position

On all strokes, but esp backhand, and serve too, get sense that but cap is pulled towards 45 in a very quick snap.  This is similar to s curve?

Key to getting racquet tip down on serve is to let hand be loose.  

Finish stroke at impact. 

Leaning into shot is not just to get more power, but also to get a cleaner contact.

Get the leaning feeling just like on the forehand.  

Go for the "pop" sound like on the self feed.  Snap up or to the side to crack on the ball, go for gunshot sound.  This will force the Sine curve
